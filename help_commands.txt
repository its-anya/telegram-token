## Channel Posting

- When a video is posted in a registered channel, the bot will automatically generate a short link and reply in the channel.

## Token System

- Users must join required channels to use the bot
- Users must refresh their token by clicking the "Refresh Token" button and passing through an ad
- Token is valid for 24 hours
- Premium users do not need a token and have ad-free access

## Premium Membership

- To remove all ads and token restrictions, purchase premium via UPI/QR (see in-bot instructions)
- Use the "Remove All Ads In One Click" button in the bot for payment details

## Troubleshooting

- If videos aren't generating URLs, make sure the bot is running and has admin privileges in your channel
- Use `/list_channels` to see if your channel is registered
- Use `/setup_special_channel` if your channel is not listed
- If you have issues with token refresh, check your ad blocker or try a different browser
